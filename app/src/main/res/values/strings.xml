           1-> One player, the Chooser, thinks of a four-letter word and the other player, the Guesser, tries to guess it.

        \n\n2-> At each turn the Guesser tries a four-letter word, and the Chooser says how close it is to the answer by giving:

        \n\n The number of Bulls - letters correct in the right position.
        \n\n The number of Cows - letters correct but in the wrong position.
        \n\n3-> The Guesser tries to guess the answer in the fewest number of turns.

    \n\n Note:- If either word has repeated letters the rule is that each letter can only count towards the score once, and Bulls are counted before Cows.
